LLM Chatbot – Project Tasks and Implementation Guide

Overview

This document outlines the multi-stage development of an advanced LLM-based chatbot, with incremental enhancements across multiple tasks. Each stage builds upon the previous, aiming for a production-ready, fully deployed chatbot.

The project consists of the following stages:

1. Basic chatbot deployment using Docker.
2. Attachment analysis (images, PDFs, text files).
3. Vector Embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
4. Agentic AI integration.
5. Function-calling framework for tool integration.

Task 1 – LLM Chatbot with Docker

Goal:

* Develop and deploy a basic LLM chatbot using Docker.

Task 2 – Attachment Analysis Capability

Goal:

* Extend the chatbot to accept and analyze user attachments, including images, PDFs, and text files.
* Implement extraction pipelines using tools such as PyMuPDF (PDF), Tesseract OCR (images), and plain-text parsers.

Implementation Steps:

1. Research algorithms and techniques for processing different file types.
2. Implement an /upload endpoint to handle file uploads.
3. Integrate extraction logic and LLM analysis.


Task 3 – Vector Embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Goal:

* Implement vector embeddings for uploaded documents and enable RAG for context-aware responses.

Implementation Steps:

1. Extract and chunk text from documents.
2. Generate embeddings using OpenAI or other models.
3. Store embeddings in a vector database such as FAISS, Chroma, or Milvus.
4. Retrieve relevant chunks on user queries.
5. Combine retrieved chunks into prompts for LLM responses.


Task 4 – Agentic AI Integration

Goal:

* Add autonomous decision-making capabilities to the chatbot, enabling it to act as an AI agent.

Implementation Steps:

1. Integrate an agentic framework such as LangChain Agents.
2. Configure the chatbot to decide actions and reasoning paths dynamically.


Task 5 – Function-Calling Framework and External Tools

Goal:

* Extend the chatbot to trigger external tools for advanced capabilities beyond file reading.
* Implement at least three tools such as Web Search and Retrieval, Code Snippet Runner (sandboxed), and Data Formatter/Converter.

Implementation Steps:

1. Implement function-calling architecture.
2. Integrate tools with proper input and output handling.
3. Enable multi-step tool chaining.
